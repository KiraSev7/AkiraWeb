                <h3>A Little About me.</h3>
            <p>
            I don't have any work experience yet, but I have always been sharpening my skills, particularly in languages and computers. I actively take various courses to enhance my skills, especially in learning different languages. Currently, I am focused on learning English, Japanese, and Mandarin.

            Additionally, I have a strong proficiency in operating computer systems and various applications, with a deep understanding of how they work and the ability to develop software. I also have knowledge of security systems and website development.

            <p>
            My future goal is to become a language expert capable of communicating in various languages and reaching the pinnacle of my professional career. I firmly believe that the philosophy of learning from mistakes is the key to creating a better future, one that will have a positive impact not only on myself but also on the people around me.
